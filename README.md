# PROTECTING  DATA USING  ENCRYPTION
Data encryption is the process of transforming information into an unreadable form, ensuring that only authorized parties can access and understand it.

# Objective: 
With the increase of hacking our private information is not
safe for any network. If we put some value across the information, it will
difficult to hack. That's why it is going to very secure and helpful to us.

# Tools/Technology:
1. Computer or PC,
2. Browser like Google Chrome,
3. Notepad
4. Network,
5. Cyber Security.
6.  MATLAB etc.

# System of Recognition Number plate:
1. Pre-processing.
2. Encryption,
3. Decryption
4. Eror check etc.

# Projeet Goals:
I. Safe information,
2. Give a secure communication,
3. How to face attack, etc

# Conclusion:
This is a sample project and it is based on Python and MATLAB. This project will help us to give a safe communication. Government also takes benefit from our project. Because, Government has too many secret information. If Govemment communicates, hacker will try to hack it. But if Govemment uses our project, hacker can't hack it casily. That's why our project is very important and helpful to modern life.
